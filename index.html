                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Trees are among of the important thing in this planet. Without trees in our environment our world would be so different and we would have long been gone. Trees are so essential to us because of the chemical they produce which is oxygen. Living being such as ourself needs oxygen in order for us to stay alive and healthy. Providing oxygen isnâ€™t the only thing trees are known for, trees also help combat climate change by absorbing the toxic carbon emission produce by large factories and vehicles. Landslide and flooding also has less chance to occur when trees are in abundance.</p>

                    <h2>Impact of tree planting on our planet</h2>
                    <p>Tree planting has so many good effects for our environment. First and for more, if everyone planted trees our planet will have cleaner air to breath. Temperature during summer will also be reduce because there is a lot of shade we can use to hide from the heat of the sun. The effects of climate change will slow down if trees are planted regularly due to trees absorbing carbon dioxide. Aside from humans, animals greatly benefits tree planting as well. Many animals lost their natural habitat because of deforestation but if we could unite together and plants more tree, we can slowly restore the habitats of these animals. Lastly, earth in general would become aesthetically more beautiful and a wonderful place to live on. </p>

                    <h2>Beneficiaries of tree planting</h2>
                    <p>Realistically, everyone on this planet would benefit greatly from tree planting even more so for the next generation of people. If each individual of us has a mindset to give a better life to the next generation of people. Tree planting is one of the best projects we can do today to give them a better life. If our planet would lose majority of its trees and rainforest and climate change continue to worsen then the next generation of people would likely suffer. That is why we must plant trees if we want to save the future of human kind.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another beneficiary of tree planting is our animals. Animals are essential for our ecosystem to function properly. With non-stop deforestation going on many animals becomes endangered like the Philippine eagle. With tree planting we have the chance to save them and provide a habitat for them. </p>

                    <h2>Why is it important to plant trees?</h2>
                    <p>Earth is the only planet we know of right now that can cater life but as time passes and human evolves our planet has come to a point that it is becoming unhabitable for many. We have lost so much of our rainforest due to deforestation and civilization advancement over the last century. According to studies 34% of the world rain forest is completely gone and only 36% percent remains intact today. This is the sad reality that we are living right now and a problem that needs to be resolve as soon as possible. Let us not wait for our planet to become unhabitable, while is still early let us try and save mother earth.</p>
